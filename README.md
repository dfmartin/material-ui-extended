# material-ui-extended

Providing some react components that utilize the [material-ui](https://material-ui.com/) library.  These do not necessarily conform to the material design guidelines as set forth by Google.

This is inspired by my use of the material-ui library within a corporate project and the needs to step outside the inherent limitations of the library.
